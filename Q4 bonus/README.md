# Designing New Instructions (BONUS)

The following instructions have been created and added in the functioning of Assembler and Simulator:

|  Opcode  | Instruction | Semantics | Syntax | Type |
| :------: | :---------: | :------: | :------: | :------:|
|  10101   | Swap | Swaps the value stored in two registers i.e. reg1,reg2=reg2,reg1 | swap reg1 reg2|    C      |
|11011   |  Rotate Left  |   Rotates the value of the binary representation by specified bits towards left i.e. the value shifts forward and the value at front go towards the back       |      rl reg1 $Imm    |      B    |
| Row 3    |             |          |          |          |
| Row 4    |             |          |          |          |
| Row 5    |             |          |          |          |
| Row 6    |             |          |          |          |
